## Dataset

The dataset contains information on:
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order
- **Region**: Sales region
- **Product Category**: Category of the product sold
- **Sales Amount**: Revenue generated from each sale
- **Cost**: Cost associated with each sale
- **Profit**: Profit generated from each sale
- **Order Date**: Date when the order was placed
- **Customer Segment**: Customer segment (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Small Business)

## Project Structure

- `VicerKeeper.ipynb`: Python script that includes all the code required to load, clean, and analyze the dataset.
- `README.md`: Documentation file (this file).

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Understanding and Cleaning**
   - Load the dataset.
   - Check for missing values and handle outliers.
   - Drop unnecessary columns and preprocess data for analysis.

2. **Data Summarization**
   - Summarize total sales, total profit, and average sales by region.
   - Summarize total sales and profit by product category.
   - Calculate the profit margin for each order and determine the overall average profit margin.

3. **Trend Analysis**
   - Analyze sales trends by customer segment.
   - Examine monthly sales trends to identify any seasonal or monthly patterns.
   - Compare regional performance and identify top-performing and underperforming regions.

4. **Insights and Recommendations**
   - Derive actionable insights from the analysis results, such as identifying high-performing regions, profitable product categories, and customer segments.
   - Suggest strategies to improve underperforming regions or product categories.

## Insights and Recommendations

Based on the analysis, this project provides key insights and suggestions for the retail company to:
- Increase focus on top-performing regions and profitable customer segments.
- Improve marketing and product strategies in underperforming regions.
- Optimize inventory and pricing for high-demand product categories.

For detailed recommendations, see the code output or documentation in the analysis script.
